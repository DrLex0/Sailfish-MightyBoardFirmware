The Optiboot bootloader is an alternate extra small bootloader.

This Bootloader is only 602Bytes on 1280 and 664Bytes on 2560 long and so
it is extremly limited. But it allows for reading and writing EEPROM and
reading and burning the Flash except for the Bootloader itself. But absolutly
nothing more is needed in a 3D Printer. So we have full 3KB more space for
the Main Programm.

It is MANDATORY to set the H-Fuse to 0xDE for this bootloader to
operate correctly.

As an extra this Bootloader has an extra long (20sec) Bootloader
wait on restart using the RESET Button to make it easier to get
updates flashed. This extra delay is NOT applied on PowerOn.
